## XML RPC multi-threaded Bruteforce Tool

This is a simple implementation of an XML RPC API bruteforce tool that runs in multi-thread mode, and it's been inspired from this article: [Exploiting the XML RPC PHP on all Wordpress Versions](https://nitesculucian.github.io/2019/07/01/exploiting-the-xmlrpc-php-on-all-wordpress-versions/)


XML RPC is Application Program Interface that allows users to execute remote procedure calls by using a simple `username` and `password` authentication. Usually these APIs are hidden due to malicious operations executable by an attacker but in many CMS like Wordpress they are active by default.

  

## Installation

This tool has been written in Rust programming language so before running it you must ensure to have Rust toolkit installed on your pc.
Please follow the instructions here: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).


## Usage

To run the tool:

```
git clone git@github.com:gnapoli23/xmlrpc-bf.git

cd xmlrpc-bf/
```

and then type

`cargo run --release -- --help`

  
The output will be:

```
A multi-threaded brute force tool to execute XMLRPC API attacks


USAGE:

xmlrpc-bf [OPTIONS] --username <USERNAME> --dictionary <FILE.txt> --xml-url <XML_URL>


OPTIONS:

-u, --username <USERNAME> Username to use as target for the attack [required]

-d, --dictionary <FILE.txt> Dictionary containing the passwords for the attack [required]

-x, --xml-url <XML_URL> XML RPC API url for the attack [required]

-t, --threads-num <THREADS_NUM> Number of threads to run [optional, default=5]

-h, --help Print help information

-V, --version Print version information
```

## Improvements

There are differente improvements that could be done:
- use of `system.multicall` instead of sending `n` single request. The initial implementation of the tool was based on this particulare RPC API but during development i found that it was difficult to share information info about a possible match found. The crate `xmlrpc` on which this tool is based unfortunately does not provide a mean to map each request sent through `system.multicall` to its relative response.
- add an optional argument to run the requests through TOR Network
- add cli auto-completion using [clap_complete](https://crates.io/crates/clap_complete)
- add file reading also for target username

Please feel free to suggest any other change to the tool, any advice is well accepted!
